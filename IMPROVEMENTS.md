# Project Improvements Debrief

## Code Quality and Readability

The current implementation could be improved by introducing TypeScript for better type safety and code documentation. The codebase would benefit from breaking down the large processing functions into smaller, more focused units following the Single Responsibility Principle. Additionally, implementing a proper logging system (like Winston) instead of console.log would improve debugging and monitoring capabilities.

## Project Architecture

The architecture could be enhanced by implementing a proper service layer to separate business logic from data access. Introducing a dependency injection system would make the code more testable and maintainable. The project would also benefit from implementing the Repository pattern for data access, making it easier to switch between different data sources or add caching layers. Moving from in-memory queues to a proper message queue system (like Redis or RabbitMQ) would improve reliability and scalability.

## Code Performance

Performance could be significantly improved by implementing parallel processing for independent operations and introducing caching for frequently accessed data. The current implementation makes multiple API calls for each meeting's attendees, which could be optimized by implementing batch association fetching. Database operations could be optimized by implementing proper indexing strategies and using bulk operations for insertions. Additionally, implementing a circuit breaker pattern would improve system resilience when dealing with external API failures.
